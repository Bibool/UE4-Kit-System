# UE4-Kit-System
A simple to use but expandable loadout system based on Star Wars First Assault built in C++.

It is fairly simple to include and use within projects.
It uses primarily DataTables to power it's logic.
It was made within the FPSK Template but uses none of it's feature. It just needs to be retargetted and that's it.
